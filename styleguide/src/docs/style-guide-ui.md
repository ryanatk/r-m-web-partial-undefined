To ensure that **we only export assets needed by consumers of the style guide package**, all changes to the look & feel of the style guide itself should be made within the `ui` directory, found in the root of this project. In contrast, changes to style guide components are made within the `src` directory, on the same root level.

### CSS Overrides

All styles pertaining to the style guide itself are made in `/ui/assets/styles/partials/_revolve-overrides.scss`

### JavaScript Overrides

All javascript pertaining to the style guide itself are made in `/ui/assets/scripts/revolve-overrides.js`
