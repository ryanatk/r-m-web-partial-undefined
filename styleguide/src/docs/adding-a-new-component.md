When adding a new component

1. Determine <a href="index.html#sections">in which section</a> the new component belongs
1. Break it down to the smallest possible example, creating multiple components when necessary. *When creating multiple related components, a good naming convention can be used to group them together, for example <a href="helpers.html#colors">Colors</a>*
1. Ensure the HTML you provide can be copy+pasted into the site with little modification
1. Provide "notes" for possible variations or considerations for future users
