  Performs validation on a form via a form submission or via a trigger. To
  provide this validation, add a `data-validate` attribute on a form or element
  like so:

  ```html
  <form data-validate="true">
    <input type="text" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```

  Although by default, the validation is triggered by form submit, it can also
  occur by applying a `data-validate-trigger` attribute that will trigger a
  validation like so:

  ```html
  <form data-validate="true">
    <input type="text" required>
    <a data-validate-trigger="true" href="/go-to-some-place">Go To Some Place</a>
  </form>
  ```

  This can be applied to any element that should trigger a validation.

  For both `data-validate` and `data-validate-trigger`, to follow how HTML
  attributes work, neither attributes need a value, but they have been provided
  here for clarity. Therefore, just setting `data-validate` and
  `data-validate-trigger` without any value is acceptable.

  The validation will hook into the [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation)
  to see whether any of the elements are invalid. However, there are
  "constraints" with the constraint validation API (Thank you folks, I'll be
  here all week!). Therefore, there are additional data validate attributes
  that provide more granular validation:

  - `data-validate-not-empty`: Ensures the field is not empty. Different from
  from the `required` attribute as it's only invalid upon blur or submission
  - `data-validate-not`: Ensures the field isn't set to a specific value.
  It's similar to the `pattern` attribute except you don't have to monkey
  around with regular expressions.

  Here are some examples:

  ```html
  <form data-validate="true">
    <!-- Will apply an invalid pseudo class either on blur or submit when the field doesn't have a value -->
    <input id="not-empty-example" name="not-empty-example" type="text" data-validate-not-empty="true">
    <!-- Will apply an invalid pseudo class either on blur or submit when the field equals nice marmot -->
    <input id="not-example" name="not-example" type="text" data-validate-not="nice marmot">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```

  The idea is that new data-validate attributes can be added later on and
  reused.
