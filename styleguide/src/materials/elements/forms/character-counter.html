notes: |
  The character counter will display the number of characters used based on
  the `maxlength` attribute set on the form field, i.e. an input, textarea, or
  something similar. It'll accept the following data attributes on the field:

  - `data-character-counter-add-class-name`: allows for a custom class name to
    be added to the feedback mechanism created within.
  - `data-character-insert-position`: the insert position based the element
    passed in using the position values found on insertAdjacentHTML. If this
    doesn't exist, it'll use the one provided on wiring, and then fallback to
    afterbegin.

  Based on the insert position, CSS should be used to handle the physical
  location of the feedback mechanism.
