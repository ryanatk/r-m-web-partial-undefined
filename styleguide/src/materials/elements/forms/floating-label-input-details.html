  Demonstrates how to use the more details floating label. The purpose behind
  this is to always show a more details icon regardless of the state of the
  field. When the icon has been interacted with, it will open a modal and
  leverages all it's supported [data attributes of a modal](modules.html#modals).

  Here are the minimum data attributes/requirements needed:

  - `data-iconify-details`: Denotes to use the iconify floating label for a more
  details
  - `data-open`: A reference to a modal that exists in the DOM

  See the [modal documentation](modules.html#modals) for more details on how
  to configure a modal.
