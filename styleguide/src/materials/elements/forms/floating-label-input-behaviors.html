  Demonstrates how to use a floating label with built in behaviors or using a
  standard set of icons that dictate behavior. The following data attributes
  are supported to use this functionality:

  - `data-iconify-valid`: shows when a field is valid and able to be submitted
  - `data-iconify-invalid`: shows when a field has an error
  - `data-iconify-clear`: shows when the value in the field can be cleared

  The value of these data attributes is the title element within the SVG icon
  that is used for both i18n and accessibility. The icons can be mismatched
  based on the use case. For example, let's say an icon doesn't have any
  validation, so it may not make sense to have an invalid or valid icon, but it
  might be nice to have a clear icon so the user has the ability to clear the
  field.
