notes: |
  This includes both a carousel and the product image zoom feature. The zoom
  feature intentionally will not work for desktop since no pinch events are
  currently no supported by Desktop browsers, well at least without it being
  introduced.

  This module expects certain data attributes:

  ```

  @param {array} images - Images used consumed when zooming
  @param {string} tapToZoom - i18n text used for the tap to zoom badge
  @param {string} noImages - i18n text used when no images have been provided
  ```

  Toggle the code to see an example.

{{> image-carousel
  modifier="product-zoom"
  brand=pdp.brand
  name=pdp.name
  idPrefix=pdp.styleNumber
  images=pdp.carousel
  tap-to-zoom="Tap to Zoom"
  no-images="Got no images dude"
}}
