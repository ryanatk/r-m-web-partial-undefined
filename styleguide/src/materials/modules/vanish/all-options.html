  Vanish is responsible for having an element/container disappear based on an
  inner element being interacted with inside of the container. This example
  provides all the defaults that can be provided, which can be mixed and
  matched. For a more thorough breakdown of each:

  - `data-vanish-target`: contains a jQuery selector of what elements will
    trigger an element to vanish.
  - `data-vanish-hidden-class-name`: Class name applied when the vanish has
    been triggered.
  - `data-vanish-remove-delay`: The delay applied for when the element should
    be removed from the DOM.
