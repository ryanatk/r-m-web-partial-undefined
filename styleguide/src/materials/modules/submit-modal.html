notes: |
  The submit modal is used to make an ajax request and show a modal that
  leverages work done in the [modal module](#modals). It will take all the
  fields in the form, serialize them based on the content type, and if the
  submission was successful, it will show a modal. If a form has a `submit-modal`
  CSS class name, then this treatment will be applied. Here are the required
  data attributes for submit modal:

  - `data-submit-modal-url`: a string containing the URL for the ajax request,
    defaults back to the action attribute on the form, but if that doesn't
    exist, an error is thrown

  Here are the optional data attributes that can be applied to the submit modal:

  - `data-submit-modal-method`: a string containing the method of the request,
    falls back to the method attribute on the form, but if that doesn't exist,
    falls back to GET
  - `data-submit-modal-headers`: an object of request headers
  - `data-submit-modal-request-content-type`: the content type for the request,
    defaults to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  - `data-submit-modal-request-charset`: a string containing the character set,
    defaults to UTF-8
