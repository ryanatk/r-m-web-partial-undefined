notes: |
  JavaScript forwards a user when `color` dropdown is changed.
  This is based on the **required** `data-href` attribute of the `option`.
  A `value` can optionally be added to the `option`, and it will submit with the form,
  however it means nothing to the front-end, as the color is tied to the URL.

{{#> floating-label-select id="color" label="Color"
  fieldClassName="product__color" fieldModifier=modifier
}}
  {{#each pdp.colors}}
    <option data-href="{{this.href}}">{{this.label}}</option>
  {{/each}}
{{/floating-label-select}}
