  Illustrates how a rating scale works when form validation has been applied. To
  apply form validation to the rating scale, add the `validate-radio-group`
  className to the element containing the rating scale. Therefore, the element
  containing the rating scale should at least have a `rating-scale` and
  `form-section` classNames.

<form class="form form-no-submit" data-validate="true">
  {{> rating-scale
      starRatings=writeReview.starRatings
      required=true
      append-id="-required"
      fieldset-class-name="validate-radio-group"
      error-message="Please rate this item"
      insert-error-after=".form-section__title"}}
  <button type="submit" class="btn">Submit Rating Scale</button>
</form>
