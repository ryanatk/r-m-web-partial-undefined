notes: |
  Allows a user to apply a rating within 1 to 5 stars. Upon interacting with
  the stars, the title will change based on the rating. The title can be found
  on a field level containing the star in a `data-rating-text` attribute, for
  the ease of i18n.

  The value is captured in a radio button fieldset, such that each radio has
  the same name attribute for ease of collecting the value. This version does
  not have any validation. Therefore, if this is submitted and no value is
  present, the form submission will be prevented.
