notes: |
  Which side(s) the margin is applied is determined by the following modifier on the `u-margin` helper class: `a`ll, `t`op, `r`ight, `b`ottom, `l`eft.
  *The examples provided below show margin on all sides `u-margin-a`*

  This initial example shows a `div` with no margin:
---

<div class="u-margin-a--none">Margin None</div>
