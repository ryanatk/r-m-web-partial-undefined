  @placeholders

  This file is used to pull CSS from mixins into placeholders.
  Use these placeholders in your `scss` files, like so:
    `.selector { @extend %myPlaceholder; }`
  Placeholders have the advantage of only outputting styles once,
    including multiple selectors, saving page weight.
  Placeholders have 2 main drawbacks:
    1. they don't work within media blocks
    2. because they're hoisted, they may be overridden by later styles
  When presented with 1 of these problems, instead use the mixin, like so:
    `.selector { @include myMixin(); }`
